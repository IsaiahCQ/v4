Program: AN/APY-9 Radar - Radar Processing Bench (RPB).

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> RPB</text>: a high fidelity live virtual constructive radar test environment, that can be used to validate and verify advanced radar capabilities in a lab.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Completed</text> six Sprints as a member of the RPB software team, during which I worked on <b style='color: #6d999e'> Jira</b> stories, completed/closed tickets, stress tested <b style='color: #6d999e'> hardware deliverables</b>, tested software releases, and collected <b style='color: #6d999e'> analytical data</b> from the RPB.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Worked</text> alongside a level 4 software engineer to implement a RPB feature requested by a customer. The feature added <b style='color: #6d999e'> flight simulations</b> that utilize <b style='color: #6d999e'> Real-time data processing</b> to modify and/or create conditions/variables while a simulation is active. This allows our customers to <b style='color: #6d999e'> effectively</b> deliver future E-2D mission capabilities to the aircraft.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Developed</text> a maintenance script for auto-generated datasets hosted on the RPB. The script recursively combed through directories, verifying that the directoryâ€™s data is aligned with the guidelines set by my team, and, if needed, would restructure any incorrect directories.
