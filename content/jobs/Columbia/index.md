- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Research:</text> Using tide gauge and GPS/GNET data to quantify the effects of Glacial Adjustment on the local sea level budget of Greenland and Northeast Canada.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Built</text> upon previous research by extending historical tide gauge and GPS datasets. Which were used to assess modern-day GIA models. I also updated the relative sea-level change estimates for Greenland

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Created</text> projections for the tide gauge and GPS/GNET datasets by constructing <b style='color: #6d999e'> ARIMA </b> and <b style='color: #6d999e'> SARIMAX </b> linear regression models. The projections were used to quantify the seasonality of the datasets and explore non-linear long-term trends.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Utilized</text> the geographic information system application <b style='color: #6d999e'> QGIS</b>, to design a topographical map that depicts the vertical uplift caused by glacial adjustment.

- <text style='color: #6d999e'> Presented</text> my research at the American Geophysical Unionâ€™s Fall 2020 conference (link: <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/735656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> ED037-0025 </a>).

- Coding language/s used during this internship:<b style='color: #6d999e'> Python</b>.
